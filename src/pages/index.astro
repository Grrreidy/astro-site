			<h1>Hello, I’m Geri</h1>
			<p>I’m a digital accessibility consultant from London. I&nbsp;design for scale and I advocate for inclusion.</p>

			<img src="/images/geri.jpg" alt="Geri Reid, a white woman with mid-length dark hair, speaking on stage at a conference">

			<p style="padding-top: var(--space-m)">Accessibility is about designing websites, apps and software that everyone can use. I think it's important that everyone is included.</p>
			
			<p>I'm currently Lead Accessibility Specialist at <a href="https://www.just-eat.co.uk/">Just Eat Takeaway.com</a>. Previously, I’ve been a UX design and accessibility lead on design systems at <a href="https://www.newskit.co.uk/">News UK</a> and <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/">Lloyds Banking Group<a/>, and set up design system foundations at <a href="https://www.bpp.com/">BPP</a> and <a href="https://www.checkout.com/">Checkout.com</a>. Way back, I designed digital products at <a href="https://www.ubs.com/uk/en.html">UBS</a> and <a href="https://www.ml.com/">Bank of America</a>. </p>
			
			<p>I <a href="/speaking">speak</a> and <a href="/blog">write</a> about accessibility. My aim is to shift inclusive design from extra effort to everyday practice.</p>
