			<h2>How accessible is this website</h2>

			<p>Parts of this website are not fully accessible. For example:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Some pages are not written in plain English. The work I do is technical and described using technical terms. I test website copy and attempt to achieve the best possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">Flesch Reading Ease score</a>. I do my best but it is sometimes hard to describe technical things using plain English.</li>
			<li>Videos of my talks come from external conferences and do not always have subtitles and closed captions.</li>
			<li>I am a designer and a self-taught coder. I appreciate I don't always code things in the most technically accessible way. If you spot anything I could improve or have suggestions, please get in touch</a>.</li>
