# Designing an Accessible Future

Writeup of my talk at [WDC](https://webdevconf.com/), applying the principles of WCAG 3.0 to some current visions of the future.

## If you prefer to read, here's the text üëá

As an industry, we measure accessibility using WCAG ‚Äì the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. There‚Äôs a huge update on the horizon: [WCAG 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/), which is proposing a radical change to the way we test and measure accessibility.

I used this talk to dig into the draft to explore what the future of accessibility might look like, and how we can get ahead of it now.

They‚Äôre saying it‚Äôll be at least five years before WCAG 3.0 rolls out ‚Äì so what will the internet look like by then?

## So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs wrong with WCAG 2.x?

The Silver Community Group identified key issues with WCAG 2.x:

### ‚òû Usability  
It reads like a legal document. It‚Äôs daunting for beginners and hard to sell to stakeholders.

### ‚òû Conformance model  
It‚Äôs binary: pass or fail. But humans don‚Äôt always fit into neat boxes.

### ‚òû Maintenance  
WCAG 2.0 was published in 2008 ‚Äî the year the first iPhone launched.

Read the [problem statements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Problem_Statements).

## What‚Äôs new in WCAG 3.0?

- Easier to read and understand
- Covers a broader range of disabilities
- Designed to evolve with technology
- Focuses on real-world accessibility, not just box-ticking

## Key changes

### Guidelines  
[Example guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#guidelines) include functional categories, critical errors, and rating scales.

### How-to guide  
[How-to docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2021/how-tos/text-alternatives/) explain why something matters and how to implement and test it using [methods](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/methods/images-of-text/).

### Critical errors  
Defined per guideline. For example, missing alt text that prevents task completion is a critical error. You can‚Äôt pass if you have any critical errors.

### Testing  
Two types proposed:
- Atomic tests: automated checks.
- Holistic tests: usability testing with assistive tech.

### Conformance levels  
- Instead of A/AA/AAA, it‚Äôs Bronze, Silver, Gold.
- To score Silver or Gold, you‚Äôll need holistic testing.

### Terms comparison

| WCAG 2.x                  | WCAG 3.0        |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Non-interference          | Critical errors |
| Success Criteria          | Outcomes        |
| Techniques                | Methods         |
| Understanding             | How to          |
| Level A, AA, AAA          | Bronze, Silver, Gold |

### Putting it all together

*Adapted from the [WCAG 3.0 explainer](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-explainer/)*

---

## Other notable changes

### User-generated content  
First mention of social media, uploads, etc.  

### Clear Words  
Plain language for people with cognitive disabilities.  

### Improved colour contrast  
WCAG 3.0 introduces [APCA](https://www.myndex.com/APCA/), a perceptual contrast measure.  

![Example contrast buttons](/images/wcag2-colour-contrast.png)  
*Sometimes the option that passes is harder to read!*

Key takeaways:
- New scale: 0‚Äì100
- Accounts for type size/weight
- Context-aware (foreground/background)

## Thinking ahead: Web3

What will the web look like in five years?

> ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs heard of Web3?‚Äù  
> *All hands go up.*  
> ‚ÄúWho understands it?‚Äù  
> *All hands go down.*

Web3 is full of promise ‚Äî open, inclusive, decentralised. But in reality? It‚Äôs complex, opaque, full of jargon and acronyms:

![Web3 terminology meme](/images/web3-terms.png)  
*So many unfamiliar terms.*

üîó [What is Web3? ‚Äì Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2022/05/what-is-web3)

Even Web3‚Äôs creators admit it‚Äôs inaccessible. In [this Wired interview](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/), Gavin Wood suggests people should ‚Äúbother educating themselves.‚Äù

I did ‚Äî it took me 20 hours.

## Web3 has a serious accessibility problem

‚ÄúClear Words‚Äù would score Web3 a 0.

There are financial, cognitive, and technical barriers. The crypto space is dominated by white men. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2021/04/06/the-cryptocurrency-tycoons-on-forbes-2021-billionaires-list/?sh=2550079425e2), every crypto billionaire in 2021 was male; most went to elite universities.

The [NFT market](https://arttactic.com/product/nft-art-market-report-november-2021/) wasn‚Äôt much better ‚Äî 55% of revenue went to just 16 artists.

We have a chance to course-correct. Let‚Äôs build something better.

## Humanity Centred Design

Donald Norman is moving from Human Centred to Humanity Centred Design in his upcoming book, [Design for a Better World](https://jnd.org/design-for-a-better-world-table-of-contents/#_ftn1).

### Principles:

- Solve root problems
- Think ecosystem-wide
- Take the long view
- Test with the community
- Design with‚Äînot for‚Äîpeople

Accessibility and inclusion fits right into this.

## Is an accessible future one without screens?

Voice and gesture interfaces can bypass barriers.

- [Amazon Echo helps blind users](https://uk.pcmag.com/features/92743/why-amazons-alexa-is-life-changing-for-the-blind)
- [Show and Tell tool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GSNFRLBMD26UK9PA)
- [Alexa day-to-day uses](https://lifeofablindgirl.com/2020/01/19/20-things-the-amazon-echo-can-make-easier-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-people/)
- [Apple Watch gesture controls](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212760)

Without screens, there's no colour contrast to worry about ‚Äî everything becomes UX, content and journey.

## Get a headstart on WCAG 3.0

### Watch the draft evolve  
Follow updates from [Deque](https://www.deque.com/blog/)

### Prioritise critical errors  
See [WCAG explainer](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-explainer/#critical-errors)

### Test with disabled users  
To score Silver or Gold, you‚Äôll need [holistic testing](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#holistic-tests)

### Use awareness days  
[Global Accessibility Awareness Day](https://accessibility.day/) is a great moment to rally teams

### Learn from disabled people  
Follow their blogs and social channels. Search YouTube for screen reader demos.

### Most importantly‚Ä¶ prioritise accessibility  
Automated testing gets you 59% there. Don‚Äôt aim for perfect ‚Äî aim for progress.

As people building the internet, you have power. Whether our future is decentralised or dystopian, every improvement counts.

![Slide: Good accessibility is about compliance, great accessibility is about empathy](/images/great-accessibility-is-about-empathy.jpg)  
*Quote from Sheri Byrne-Haber ‚Äì photo by [Josh Tumath](https://twitter.com/JoshTumath/status/1577980209625792513)*

You are the internet makers. That comes with responsibility. Make it accessible.
