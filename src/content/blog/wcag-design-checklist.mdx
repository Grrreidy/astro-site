# WCAG for designers

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the technical standard for accessibility compliance. 

WCAG is complicated! As a designer-turned-accessibility lead, I know firsthand how overwhelming it can feel. To help, I’ve simplified the WCAG criteria most relevant to design into plain, human-friendly language.

Regardless of technical compliance, remember that accessibility is about people. WCAG compliance provides a baseline, but meeting the technical standard doesn’t automatically mean your product is usable. Humans are messy and complicated — just like their needs.

## Got 30 seconds? Start here

WCAG has three levels of conformance:

- **A**: The minimum level  
- **AA**: The 'technically accessible' level most organisations aim for  
- **AAA**: A high standard of technical compliance. Many of the criteria that help people with cognitive disabilities sit within AAA so it's worth striving for

Everything in WCAG hangs off [four guiding principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/). Is your digital product:

- Perceivable?  
- Operable?  
- Understandable?  
- Robust?

Your content should work for users no matter how they access it. Think:

- A screen reader announcing your content audibly  
- Someone zoomed in to 200%  
- A user on a noisy train or standing outside in bright sunlight

If you consider these principles when you design, you’re already making a huge difference. Got a little more time? Jump in here…

## Colour

### Use of Colour (A)

Don’t rely on colour alone to communicate meaning or to distinguish visual elements. People see colours differently, are colour blind or have difficulty telling different colours apart.

**How can I use colour thoughtfully?**

- Provide an additional indicator to colour – a visible border, label, underline or icon.  
- If charts and graphics rely on colour, add distinctive, non-colour differences like hatching patterns or directly applied labels.  
- [Learn about colour blindness](https://webaim.org/articles/visual/colorblind)  
- Install this [colour blindness simulator](https://colororacle.org/) to check your designs.

### Contrast minimum (AA)

Giving text a strong contrast colour against the background makes it easier for people to read and interact with.

The contrast ratio should be at least:

- **4.5:1** for text smaller than **24px**, or **19px bold**  
- **3:1** for text larger than **24px**, or **19px bold**

**How can I test colour contrast?**

- Use a contrast checker like [this one from The Paciello Group](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/)  
- Or use an [online colour contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)  
- If you design UI, the [Stark plugin](https://www.getstark.co/) is well worth the investment

[WCAG guidelines 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum)

---

### Non-Text contrast (AA)

All components and graphics must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colours, unless they are purely decorative.

This applies to icons, charts, infographics and controls — including hover or active states.

**How can I test non-text contrast?**

- Use a [contrast checker](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) and look for 'non-text contrast'

[WCAG guidelines 1.4.11](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)

- [Focus indicator states](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G195)  
- [Icons](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G207)  
- [Text in or over graphics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G18)

---

### Focus visible (AA)

It must be easy to tell which element has keyboard focus. This helps sighted keyboard users orient themselves within the page and confidently interact with it.

**How can I ensure visible focus?**

- Provide a strong visible focus indicator on links, buttons, form fields  
- Make the focus state different from the hover state  
- Ensure the focus indicator has 3:1 contrast against the background  
- If in doubt, use the browser default

## Copy

As a designer, you often write placeholder copy without thoughtful consideration. Button text, link text, headings — these small bits of microcopy often make it to development. Thoughtful copy has a big impact.

### Images of text (AA)

Text that is essential to the journey must not be part of an image. It can't be resized and becomes blurry when magnified.

**What if there's no alternative?**

If you must use it, provide thoughtful alt text for the image. Developers shouldn’t be expected to write this — it’s your job.

[WCAG guidelines 1.4.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html)

---

### Headings and labels (AA)

Headings must describe the topic of the section. Labels must clearly indicate their related form field’s purpose.

**What makes a good heading or label?**

- Clear copy helps people with reading difficulties and screen reader users  
- Use proper heading levels and avoid ALL CAPS  
- Label form fields clearly and avoid ambiguity

[WCAG guidelines 2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html)

---

## Layout

### Meaningful Sequence (A)

Order content logically to match how users read or navigate your design.

**Why is this important?**

- The user must access content in the correct order  
- This affects screen reader users and users with CSS disabled  
- Plan the semantic structure early to save dev time

[WCAG guidelines 1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/meaningful-sequence.html)

**Related criteria**

- [Semantic structure](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/)  
- [Understanding parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing)

---

### Orientation (AA)

Your design must not require a specific screen orientation — unless essential (like a VR or TV app).

[WCAG guidelines 1.3.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/orientation.html)

---

### Resize text (AA)

Users must be able to resize text up to 200%.

This helps people with low vision. Ensure your layout still works at large text sizes. Avoid fixed-width containers that prevent copy from reflowing.

[WCAG guidelines 1.4.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html)

---

### Consistent navigation (AA)

Navigation that appears across pages should be consistent.

**How?**

- Menus and breadcrumbs should work and look the same everywhere

[WCAG guidelines 3.2.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-navigation.html)

---

### Sensory characteristics (A)

Instructions must not rely on visual cues alone.

**What to avoid**

- Instructions like “click the red button” or “see the right-hand column”

[WCAG guidelines 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/sensory-characteristics.html)

---

### Consistent identification (AA)

Features used in multiple places must be identified consistently.

**Tips**

- Label buttons the same way every time  
- Label form fields consistently  
- Use consistent icons
