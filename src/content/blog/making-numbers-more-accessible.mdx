# Making numbers more accessible

I recently had a dyscalculia assessment. I clearly suck at maths but it was kind of a relief to get a formal diagnosis.

Dyscalculia is a persistent difficulty in understanding numbers. Along with your ability to do maths, it affects time, estimation, quantity and direction.

You develop workarounds. You buy a digital watch and read the numbers off because you can't tell the time. When eating out in groups, you either pick up the whole bill (ouch) or throw your card on the table and sneak off to the bathroom (awkward). You become accustomed to your family laughing at your comedically sized internet purchases.

According to the [British Dyslexia Association](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyscalculia), about 6% of people have dyscalculia. It‚Äôs often linked to other forms of neurodivergence, like dyslexia or autism.

I recently recorded a podcast with [Laura Parker](https://lauraparker.design/), a dedicated advocate for designing to help folks with dyscalculia, low numeracy and maths anxiety. If you haven‚Äôt already, check out her website [accessiblenumbers.com](https://accessiblenumbers.com/) or the [fab poster](https://github.com/abbott567/dyscalculia-poster/blob/main/dist/dyscalculia-poster.pdf) she contributed to Gov.uk.

Speaking to Laura is always a joy. She‚Äôs the only other person I know with dyscalculia, and her experience with numbers is spookily similar to mine. Our conversation reminded me how little guidance there is for designing with dyscalculia in mind. It‚Äôs a gap we need to fill, and as someone with lived experience, I need to shout about it more.

## How to design for people with dyscalculia

### Forgive my mistakes

Entering numbers is tricky, and errors are almost inevitable. People with dyscalculia might put numbers in the wrong field, enter incorrect dates or times, or pay the wrong amount. Build systems that allow for error correction, like validation, that lets us input numbers in the format that works for us.

Better still, use tech to reduce manual input altogether. Let me scan numbers with my phone camera instead of typing them.

> I don't trust myself to make large financial transactions. I regularly transpose numbers so I get someone else to check for me. Help is appreciated but having to ask for help leaves me feeling frustrated üòî

### Give me space

Spacing matters. If you‚Äôre showing numbers ‚Äî like appointment times or prices ‚Äî leave space around them so they‚Äôre easier to process. Whenever possible, round numbers to whole values to reduce clutter.

> Crowded tables, like travel departure boards, can be overwhelming. I‚Äôve been known to photograph the board and send it to a friend to figure out which gate I need to be at!

### Fill it in for me

Working memory is another challenge for many of us with dyscalculia. If you have information, like my account number or the amount I owe, fill it in for me.

> Avoid patterns that make me remember details, like a verification code from a previous screen. Spoilers: I won‚Äôt remember.

### Don‚Äôt rush me!

Time pressure is the enemy. Many dyscalculics struggle to tell time or estimate how long a task will take. If you must include time limits for security reasons, make the process clear and straightforward to avoid extra stress.

> Patterns like ‚ÄúYou have 3 soul-crushing minutes to complete this transaction‚Äù or ‚Äú20 other people are viewing our shitty hotel room RIGHT NOW‚Äù are anxiety-inducing. I‚Äôm much more likely to make a mistake under time pressure and hate your company.

### Offer numbers in context

Numbers without context are just...numbers. If you‚Äôre presenting data in grids or tables, consider offering a text-based alternative. A sentence that explains the numbers can make all the difference.

> The [Plain Numbers](https://plainnumbers.org.uk/) initiative showed how adding context to utility bills dramatically improved customers‚Äô comprehension.

### Involve your team

Low numeracy affects nearly 17 million people in the UK. Chances are, someone on your design or engineering team has first-hand experience. Involve them in the design process for insights you might not expect.

> Low numeracy is exclusionary. [Fair by Design](https://fairbydesign.com/) has highlighted how the "poverty premium" makes life more expensive for people who struggle with numbers. They often pay more for essentials like energy or insurance because they can‚Äôt navigate the fine print or spot a better deal.

## Getting a dyscalculia diagnosis

If you‚Äôre interested in getting assessed for dyscalculia in the UK, there‚Äôs information on the [Dyscalculia Network](https://dyscalculianetwork.com/) site. Adult assessors are in demand, so be prepared to wait for an appointment and results.

Dyscalculia assessments are not currently funded on the NHS which is sucky. If you‚Äôre fortunate to have private healthcare, this might cover some costs if your plan offers a neurodiversity pathway. Otherwise assessments are self-funded. After the assessment, you‚Äôll receive a detailed report which can be used for support in education or at work.

For me, getting assessed was for my own personal journey. It hasn‚Äôt changed how I feel about maths (still terrified!) but it has given me a better understanding of myself. The stigma around low numeracy means people often assume you‚Äôre lazy or stupid. No amount of pressure will allow me to infer data from a chart or understand the scoring system in tennis or darts (I mean, darts is basically just maths hell as a sport!).

There's a lot of societal shame around dyscalculia, low numeracy and maths anxiety. If you struggle with numbers, speaking out about it helps raise awareness and change attitudes. We can all design and build better ‚ù§Ô∏è
