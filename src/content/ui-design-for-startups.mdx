# UI Design for startups*

Over the years I've freelanced for a lot of small startups. These were often side projects alongside my main gig. Some of the UIs are kind of old and dated but I've left them here for nostalgia. It was fun to work with folks chasing their creative dreams ❤️  

** Forgive me some of the poor colour contrast and form choices I made before I learned about accessibility. I hang my head in a #999999 cloud of shame.
